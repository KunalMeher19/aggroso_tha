### About This Project

I built the **CompTracker** Competitive Intelligence Tracker as a technical assessment. My goal was to make something that genuinely works and would be useful in a real product context — not just a checkbox submission.

Design decisions I'm proud of:
- **3-attempt scraper** with exponential backoff and Googlebot UA fallback — because real-world scraping is unreliable
- **Diff chunking strategy** to stay within LLM token limits without truncating useful data
- **Change score metric** (% of content that changed) as a quick visual gauge without reading diffs
- **Premium dark UI** — I believe developer tools should look as good as they work
- **Full snapshot preview** on the competitor detail page — view the complete scraped content without character limits
- **`_redirects` file** added to the frontend for clean SPA routing on Netlify/Render (no more "Route not found" on reload)
